<p>
Wilton was a Canadian immigrant who began his life in America in NY around 1850, where he met his life-long business partner, Philo Bradley. Wilton & Bradley moved to what is now Harrisonburg in the 1860’s to begin their lives as successful entrepreneurs. In a small rural farming town, Wilton opened up a much-needed hardware store, and utilized his fantastic manufacturing connections in Baltimore and NY to bring modern goods to the valley. He was able to provide farm equipment, housing goods, and many other items that were previously out of reach. With a successful hardware store, Wilton began to invest his money in other businesses, loaning out his earnings in careful planned (mostly successful) business endeavors. Eventually, Wilton would hold rank as the President of the First National Bank, chairmen of the local hospital board, inspector of the county jail, founder of the Young Men’s Christian Association, Treasurer for the Elk’s Lodge, and much more.
</p>
<p>After mastering business in an expanding town, Wilton had his home built beginning in 1880, with construction completed in 1888. It was one of the first homes wired for electricity, which over time, has given Wilton credit for “bringing electricity” to the valley. It is also a rare example of a Queen Anne Victorian home in the south (Wilton fell in love with the style while living in New York). After Wilton’s passing, the Shenk family owned the home for years, it became a boarding house, then apartments, then played host to the TKE Fraternity for just over a decade. </p>
